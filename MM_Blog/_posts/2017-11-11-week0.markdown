With our first week in the cloud, we are elated to have been granted a soace to make our own. With persistence, we were finally able to get desks and computers by mid-week. A little digging on Craigslist also scored us a sweet couch that will allow us respite from our office chairs to collect our heads and brainstorm.

Our code progress is coming along as we decide our layout and project architecture. In the first couple weeks, we will by experimenting with API queries, javaScript modules, github team flow, new IDE's and coding standards. We are looking forward to getting our mirror hardware so that we can start interacting with Google Assistant on the Raspberry Pi.
