Development is on the up and up this week as we've toiled through training courses for our tech stack, established our framework and started hammering out features. Our fearless leader, Nastya, has conquered CSS Grid styling for the face of our mirror. Additionally, Kyle has finally established a working relationship with the 42 API and its OAuth2 token system.

# Our first framework—pre css-grid—with weather and forecast features at any location in C or F.

# We can display the current user as well as look up info for any current student.

Unfortunately we've also discovered a major blocker this week with voice recognition AI software. Our original plan of working with Google Assistant has been scrapped, after assessing possible future costs. The Jasper Project offers us an open source solution but it unfortunately has been uncooperative in installation and has too many open issues for us to pursue that too deeply. Our likely course of action for our first prototype will be to employ a Voice-to-Text Node.js package and later implement DialogueFlow to allow our program to be somewhat intuitive.

Our goals for the upcoming week will be to finally build and get users for a "pre-alpha" prototype, start storing tokens and caching API data with MongoDB, and add features such as Slack and Facebook announcements as well as a few more from the 42 API.
