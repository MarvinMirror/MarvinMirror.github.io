As we approach our first Demo Day, the pressure mounts to have some sort of product for curious cadets to probe. We've been inspired by our Skype meeting with Florin Otto, entreprener and former CEO of the smart mirror startup MyMirror. His greatest advice was to iterate and get each iteration into the hands of users as quickly as possible and so that ha become our goal for each week hence.

A great leap forward is that Janea has—in very quick order—put together most of our hardware to produce and elegant and professional mirror with rear monitor:

# Our software has a home!

![Mirror Blue Screen](/img/mirror_bs.jpg)
# Even in the light, the screen shows through nicely.

On the software side, we've updated our styling to be more professional. Nastya D. has successfully given us the most recent announcements from 42's Slack and Facebook accounts to post on our app.

# Automatically grabs the most recent announcement.

# Updated layout and styling to please our users.

At this juncture, we're also diving back into Node.js fundamentals with learning about Promises and synchronous execution of asynchronous processes. This will allow us to use the results of one query to run subsequent queries. Another thing we are learning to implement is storing values and caching data in MongoDB using the Node package "mongoose".

This week's goals are to get feedback from potential users on what is important for our project and to really come to a decision on how we will handle voice commands and natural language processing.
